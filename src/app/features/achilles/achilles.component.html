    <h1>Achilles</h1>

  <p>
    In Greek mythology, Achilles (/əˈkɪliːz/ ə-KIL-eez) or Achilleus (Ancient Greek: Ἀχιλλεύς, [a.kʰilˈleu̯s]) was a
    hero of the Trojan War, the greatest of all the Greek warriors, and is the central character of Homer's Iliad. He
    was the son of the Nereid Thetis and Peleus, king of Phthia.

    Achilles' most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan prince Hector outside the gates of
    Troy. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the Iliad, other sources concur that he was killed near the
    end of the Trojan War by Paris, who shot him in the heel with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with Statius'
    unfinished epic Achilleid, written in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body
    except for one heel, because when his mother Thetis dipped him in the river Styx as an infant, she held him by one
    of his heels. Alluding to these legends, the term "Achilles' heel" has come to mean a point of weakness, especially
    in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution. The Achilles tendon is also named after him due to
    these legends.
