  </div>
  <div>
    In Greek mythology, the Minotaur (/ˈmaɪnəˌtɔːr, ˈmɪnəˌtɔːr/ MY-nə-TOR, MIN-ə-TOR,[1] US: /ˈmɪnəˌtɑːr, -oʊ-/
    MIN-ə-TAR,
    -⁠oh-;[2] Ancient Greek: Μινώταυρος [miːnɔ̌ːtau̯ros]; in Latin as Minotaurus [miːnoːˈtau̯rʊs]) is a mythical
    creature
    portrayed in Classical times with the head and tail of a bull and the body of a man[3] or, as described by Roman
    poet
    Ovid, a being "part man and part bull".[4] He dwelt at the center of the Labyrinth, which was an elaborate maze-like
    construction[5] designed by the architect Daedalus and his son Icarus, on the command of King Minos of Crete. The
    Minotaur was eventually killed by the Athenian hero Theseus.
